                    Celeste Sheridan was a rising star with a melodic voice threatened by an aggressive throat cancer. 
                    She sought help from Obsidian, 
                    receiving experimental ectoplasmic treatments that strengthened and altered her vocal cords. 
                    Eventually she was permanently physically mutated, with pale, cold flesh and a sonic scream laced with ectoplasm. Celeste became addicted to her treatments and her improved vocal capabilities, 
                    eventually losing control of her abilities at a concert, killing many, leaving her closest friends to abandon her. 
                    After murdering her cheating boyfriend, Dead Note turned her rage on Obsidian. With her powers evolving, 
                    Dead Note's encore will prove deadly to those who stand in her way…</code>

                    Virgil Edward Slate felt as if he had the deck stacked against him. Being an albino, 
                    he was picked on constantly through his youth; every more so after his activities began to skew towards the academic. 
                    Eventually, Virgil decided that he needed to hone his body as well as his mind. His hard work brought him strength and his first taste of real power. 
                    His second taste came after he was exposed to the RIP Tide. 
                    At first, Virgil's thoughtography proved nothing more than a useful skill but as hie pushed the limits of his abilities, 
                    Virgil became enthralled with the ideal of surpassing the “filth” around him. Deducing Obsidian as the progenitor of the Ectoplasm Mutates, 
                    Virgil desired to procure another injection. This search led him to the Commandant who offered a partnership. 
                    Virgil was given what he sought and gained a secondary mutation. As smart as he is strong and with a chip on his shoulder, Virgil acts as the Commandant's primary enforcer. 
                    The Gargoyle sees no reason why he shouldn't use his powers to “level the scales” and damn anyone who gets in his way…

                    she had her insecurities which were preyed upon by her peers. 
                    Becoming a model at nineteen gave Niko some validation but also piled on the pressure given the cutthroat nature of her industry. 
                    Her self-image only worsened after she received grievous facial scars after attending the Celeste Sheridan's SeaFest concert. 
                    Secretly injected with Ectoplasm, Hasami's wounds refused to completely heal causing her psyche to severely deteriorate. 
                    Now bearing a necrotic Glasgow smile reminiscent of a figure in Japanese urban legend,

                    Whisper discovered her powers a few weeks after the RIP-Tide, deciding to use her newfound abilities to steal from those she feels are “too wealthy”. 
                    At first her thieving is done to crawl out of debt. 
                    In the process, she uncovered her kleptomaniac tendencies and came to love the thrill that comes with each heist and the growing notoriety of her new persona. 
                    Discarding any lingering guilt, Whisper adopted the identity of Whisper and soon begins leaving calling cards to taunt authorities. 
                    Wraith's pursuits of her only add to Whisper's love of danger and adrenaline as she comes to revel in their game of cat and mouse…

                    Priyanka Das was a medical student specializing in hematology hailing from India. 
                    Her studious nature gained Priyanka a paid internship with Obsidian and eventually saw her hired post-graduation, advancing through her efforts to research assistant to Desmond Troy II. 
                    She became concerned with pressures to administer an experimental new drug to victims of Celeste Sheridan’s concert. 
                    Outspoken, Priyanka became a causality of the power struggle between Troy and Langdon. 
                    She was injected with ectoplasm and presumed dead after her blood stopped flowing.
